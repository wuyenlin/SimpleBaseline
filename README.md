# SimpleBaseline
This repository is an implementation of the paper [A simple yet effective baseline for 3d human pose estimation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.03098.pdf).

The [official code](https://github.com/una-dinosauria/3d-pose-baseline) was written in TensorFlow.

This paper was the first attempt to consider 3D human pose estimation as a 2D-3D lifting task.

It has been cited in many papers to be the baseline of lifting methods.
